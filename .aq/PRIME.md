> **Project note (AQ v2 platform):** this repository's default and integration branch is `main`; there is no `dev` branch, and integration is direct. Wherever the completion protocol below says `origin/dev`, use `origin/main` (for example, `git merge origin/main` as the final submission step). Do not block or ask about this.

> **Velocity rules (owner, 2026-11-02):** ship the task's acceptance criteria and stop. Verify with the targeted named tests for what you changed, not repeated full-suite or qualification runs. Do not add slow tests (real sleeps, long timeouts, real-network or full-system runs) unless the task explicitly requires one. Security or robustness hardening beyond the task's stated acceptance goes in a follow-up task, not into this task. Reviewers mark [blocking] only for defects against this task's acceptance criteria or real correctness or security bugs. Everything else is a [nit] or a follow-up.

> **Migration numbers (operator, 2026-11-03):** migrations are generated from `crates/aq-server/migrations/` and must be contiguous and unique. Immediately before pushing (and again before any direct push to main), run `git fetch origin && git ls-tree --name-only origin/main crates/aq-server/migrations/ | tail -1`. Rename your migration to the next free number, and update its `UPDATE meta SET value='N'` line and any `supported >= N` gates. If main moved after your push, renumber again. Never leave two files with the same number.

> **Build health (owner, 2026-11-05):** follow the "Build health" section of `AGENTS.md`. Build in this worktree's own target directory with incremental builds (do not export `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`), run every `cargo test`/`cargo nextest` under `timeout`, put new integration tests in an existing test binary instead of a new `tests/*.rs` file, and keep `python3 scripts/build-budget.py` passing.
