# Results feedback v1

Generate/check `schema.json` with `cargo run --locked -p aq-server --example
results_feedback_contract [-- --check]`. Regenerate the G1 union with
`cargo run --locked -p aq-server --example dashboard_actions_contract`.
`python check.py` validates the fixtures, UTF-8 bounds, replay identity and
read/action compatibility. Runtime tests enforce retained artifact provenance,
current authority, version races and fixed Graph keys.

All paths require the current Owner and shared CSRF/maintenance/admission guards.
Mutations return `dashboard-actions-1` receipts and share `/api/v1/operations/{id}`.
Read envelopes remain `dashboard-read-1`. The G1 union admits the seven finite
kinds `result.follow`, `result.comment`, `comment.revise`, `thread.resolve`,
`feedback.task_create`, `feedback.link`, `result.evidence_waive`.

- Results: GET `/api/v1/results?mode=latest|needs_review|following`, optionally
  `scope=all_authorized|project`, `project_id`, `task_id`, `media=any|image|video|none`,
  inclusive `since_ms`/`until_ms`, `limit` (default 20, maximum 100), `cursor`.
  Membership is frozen for five minutes; every page rechecks current authority
  and retained report provenance. Cursors bind all filters, identity and size.
  Queries spanning over 1000 eligible results must narrow their filters. At most
  128 live snapshots and eight concurrent feed/comment readers per router.
- GET `/api/v1/results/{id}/revisions/{revision}`: exact retained SHA-256 report
  revision. `id` is the supersession-root Result ID (a report ID is also accepted
  for compatibility). The immutable revision contains only native submitted
  content except the legacy `addressed_feedback` compatibility projection
  described below. Native reports have no supplemental media/check fields, so
  those submitted arrays remain empty. Supplemental upload references and
  evidence availability belong to the independently versioned assessment.
- PUT `/api/v1/results/{id}/follow`: Follow payload; expected Result version.
- GET/POST `/api/v1/results/{id}/revisions/{revision}/comments`: reads use
  `limit` and `cursor`; POST uses Comment payload with **result_id and revision
  omitted** (the path supplies them). G1 union payloads include both pins.
  Replies name `thread_id` and the same anchor. Reply order uses a SQL sequence;
  cursors freeze the upper sequence. Each comment retains up to 16 revisions.
  Reads expose the complete correction history. POST
  `/api/v1/comments/{id}/revisions` uses Correction and the comment version.
- POST `/api/v1/threads/{id}/resolve`: Resolve and thread version; exact
  follow-up revision must share project/task. Linking and creating tasks leave
  threads open. Thread version advances for replies and resolution.
- POST `/api/v1/feedback-tasks`: FeedbackDraft, including expected thread version,
  exact retained comment revision, project revision and optional parent task.
  The native `task.create` fixed key and task UUID both use `operation_id`.
  A parent-child edge is created atomically in the same Graph mutation.
  GET `/api/v1/feedback-tasks/{operation_id}` names the deterministic candidate
  task while confirmation/linking is uncertain. `creation_disposition=confirmed`
  distinguishes a proven created task from an unconfirmed candidate.
  GET of the common operation reconciles a confirmed native receipt with its
  local link. POST `/api/v1/feedback-tasks/{operation_id}/recover` with `{}` is
  explicit retry under the original native key, including an interrupted intent
  before native admission. Read-only lookups never dispatch Graph mutations.
- POST `/api/v1/feedback-links`: FeedbackLink, thread version and currently
  authorized existing task. Origin records retain result/artifact/comment pins.
- POST `/api/v1/results/{id}/evidence-waivers`: Waiver and assessment version;
  exact requirement ID and pinned policy revision with an Owner reason.

Image anchors require finalized retained PNG evidence on that exact revision,
matching input or render digest, finite normalized bounds and positive extent.
Video anchors require a retained `aq.mp4.passthrough-v1` clip on that exact
revision with a matching digest and `0 <= start_ms < end_ms <= clip.duration_ms`
from the owner's receipt (never client metadata). An anchor whose kind does not
match the cited artifact's media receives typed 422 `unsupported_media_kind`.
`media=video` lists results with a retained clip, `media=image` with a retained
PNG, and `media=none` with no retained media.

Capture requirements live in append-only SQL `result_task_policies`, keyed by
project/task/policy revision. This is the administrative task-policy store;
policy authoring and completion-gate wiring belong to their task-policy owners.
The retained report transaction snapshots the latest policy, including every
requirement field. Historical reports receive explicit empty policy revision 0.
Policies are bounded and SQL-validated, support PNG image (`kind=image`) and MP4 clip
(`kind=video`) requirements, each satisfied only by its own media kind, and
cannot be corrected in place. Each required count must match finalized, retained,
not withheld evidence with exact report, scenario, environment, viewport and
claimed source, or have an authorized exact-policy waiver. Scenario/steps and
source are human claims; this evaluation establishes evidence presence, never
capture correctness or task acceptance. Assessments remain `unreviewed` until an
acceptance owner supplies that authority; G6 performs no completion-policy write.

## Additive read revision 1.1

Routes, `dashboard-read-1` envelopes, write payloads and operation identities are
unchanged. Detail (including feed items) and comments pages now advertise
`feedback_read_version: "results-feedback-1.1"`. An absent marker identifies the
original v1 response; do not treat absent legacy fields as observed server state.
The Rust decoder accepts original v1 responses through defaults. `schema-1.0.json`
retains the original schema, pinned by the compatibility fixture. Strict v1
readers that reject unknown fields must update their decoder; tolerant readers
can ignore the additive fields. Compatibility checks explicitly remove only
these documented additions before checking the frozen strict schema.

- `result.directly_following` is the current principal's retained boolean in
  `result_follows`, defaulting to false when no preference exists. It follows the
  stable Result identity across revisions and is independent of thread opt-in.
  A result can remain in Following while this value is false. The existing
  Result version remains the precondition for the follow toggle.
- Each comment has `feedback_links`, ordered by operation UUID. Each item has
  `operation_id`, `project_id`, `task_id` and `origin`. The origin retains
  `result_id`, exact `revision`, `thread_id`, `comment_id`, `comment_revision` and
  `artifacts` (artifact UUID and digest). Creation and linking use the same
  projection. Links attach only to their exact origin report/revision and
  comment, and keep the original comment revision after corrections. Linked
  task references prove the retained link, without claiming current task status.
- Each comment has nullable `resolution`. Open threads return null. Explicitly
  resolved threads return `resolved_by`, `reason`, `follow_up` (stable Result ID
  and exact revision), and `follow_up_report_id` (the exact native report UUID).
  Replies share their thread's resolution. An existing resolution is never
  inferred from a created or linked task.
- `revision.addressed_feedback` now contains sorted thread UUIDs whose explicit
  resolution pins this exact report UUID **and** revision. These are thread IDs,
  not comment IDs or task/link IDs. This legacy field is a mutable supplemental
  compatibility observation, not an immutable native submission claim. It is
  absent from the native report digest. Its changes participate in assessment
  version observation; readers must refresh this field with the assessment.
- Detail and comments pages expose `follow_up_submission: {"state":"unsupported"}`.
  There is no authoritative submission owner/record in the current system. This
  value does not mean "unsubmitted", and resolution does not turn it into
  "submitted". The supervisor authorized this bounded delivery; the separate
  submission owner/operation is a named follow-up. Creation, submission,
  resolution and result acceptance remain independent.

No new write route, SQL migration, Graph status lookup or action-union change is
introduced. The valid, invalid, replay and compatibility fixtures cover the
additions, exact retained origins and legacy decoding. Runtime tests cover reload,
principal partitioning, revision isolation, replay and real Graph creation/linking.

## Additive read field: process outcome (2026-11-06)

`revision.process_outcome` is the worker-reported process outcome of the native
report: `success`, `failed`, `cancelled`, `expired` or `unknown`. It is the value
`GET /api/human/results` exposes as `process_outcome`. It is the worker's claim
about its process, not acceptance, settlement or task completion.
`revision.summary` is the report's conclusion (`conclusion` in
`/api/human/results`). The field is optional and absent from older servers; the
read version marker stays `results-feedback-1.1`. Strict readers that reject
unknown fields must update their decoder, as for 1.1.
