# Cargo builds in AQ worker slots

Run Cargo from the root of your assigned slot. Reuse that slot's own target
directory for focused tests, lint and extracted-package qualification:

```sh
export CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$PWD/target"
export CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 RUST_TEST_THREADS=2
timeout 900 cargo test -p aq-server --locked --offline --test dashboard_actions
```

Capture the absolute target path before changing into an extracted source tree;
pass the same environment to child Cargo processes. Temporary source extraction
is fine, but do not allocate another target under `/tmp`, share another slot's
target, or use an owner's base-checkout target. Only clean your own leased target.

The workspace dev profile uses `debug = "line-tables-only"` for workspace crates,
`debug = false` for external dependencies and `incremental = true`. Cargo's test
profile inherits these settings. Workspace backtraces retain file:line locations.
Incremental makes the edit-and-retest loop several times faster (about 16 s
instead of 127 s to rebuild one aq-server test binary after an edit), at the
cost of disk: `target/debug/incremental` reaches about 2.5 GB for one test
binary and about 12 GB when every test binary has been built. Stay on one
setting per target directory, because switching rebuilds the workspace crates.
One-shot builds (CI, single-use sandboxes, and qualification scripts that build
extracted packages in fresh directories) set `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`, since they
never reuse the incremental state. Do not set `CARGO_PROFILE_DEV_DEBUG=0` or
`CARGO_PROFILE_TEST_DEBUG=0` when checking backtraces. The full build rules are
in the "Build health" section of [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md).

`aq test --aq-help` describes the installed runner. It currently accepts pytest
and Bazel, so use foreground Cargo with the limits above for Rust checks. Use
`aq test` for the applicable Python checks without increasing its worker cap.

AQ-08 qualification JSON, source hashes and raw logs retain the historical
commands and observations. For reruns, apply this target/environment guidance to
the listed focused test selection and preserve each fixture's external artifact,
database and digest requirements. A historical `/tmp` target path is not a new
target allocation instruction. Rerun commands in qualification Markdown use the
slot target; their historical results remain attributed to the recorded sources.
