# Scoped presence owner qualification

Frozen source `7a19e0a0a77f7a2faceb4470c20f05d2ea1b2bcb` in `/tmp/aq08-installed-presence` adds machine report/inventory routes, the scoped renewal consumer and ordered state31. It follows integrated state30; public admission0.1.9 and migrations029/030 are unchanged. The JSON inventory hashes exact `git show` bytes from the frozen commit, rather than live files.

The focused combined run passed54 tests, failed0 and explicitly ignored5 artifact-dependent actual Git/worker cases. It includes8 actual scoped-report HTTP cases, existing grant/renewal regressions,6 inventory tests and schema28–31 upgrade/rollback cases. Strict server all-target/all-feature Clippy and package formatting passed. Final logs are retained with SHA256 inventories.

The fixture uses actual daemon offer/Accept/material/Grant/receipt owners and explicitly synthetic worker boot/read observations. It does not qualify physical worker reads, provider execution, simultaneous-attempt placement/storage load or overall native completion. Full-workspace qualification is left to root integration.

```

Development negatives are retained separately: initial state31 omitted its SQL metadata update; the first combined state31 run exposed four state30 tests with stale final-version assertions; an invalid test-target invocation and the earlier RawSql/Send compiler diagnosis are not represented as passing qualification. Corrections are included in the frozen source and final checks pass.
